Hi, I'm North America Tim

About the world, may there be peace in the world.\
About animals, boycott all animal performances.\
About speech, I will not impose my thoughts on you.

After walking through the city and countryside, I love two places, one in Tibet and one in South Asia, how much do I love them? "I never get tired of reading you a thousand times, I feel like March when I read you".
